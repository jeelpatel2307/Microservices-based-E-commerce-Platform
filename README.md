# Microservices-based E-commerce Platform

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a microservices-based e-commerce platform in Java. The platform consists of three essential microservices:

1. **Product Service**: Manages product catalog functionalities such as product listing and details.
2. **Order Service**: Handles order creation, processing, and management.
3. **User Service**: Manages user registration, authentication, and profile information.

Each microservice is implemented using Spring Boot and exposes RESTful APIs for interaction. The platform can be extended and scaled to include additional functionalities such as payment processing, inventory management, and shipping integration.

## Components

- **Product Service**: Handles product-related functionalities.
- **Order Service**: Manages order creation, processing, and fulfillment.
- **User Service**: Manages user registration, authentication, and profile information.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open each microservice project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run each microservice individually.
4. Use HTTP requests to interact with the APIs provided by each microservice.

## Dependencies

- **Spring Boot**: A framework for building Java-based microservices.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access and manipulation.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization features.
